The train.py script requires:
- Two folders, 
      - ARCCnet/arccnet/models/temp 
      - ARCCnet/arccnet/models/weights
    are needed to store temporary files.
- An environment variable named ARCAFF_DATA_FOLDER must be set, pointing to the location where the dataset is stored.
  Default is ../../data
