        This method processes a DataFrame containing records and extracts relevant information,

        process involves searching for specific patterns within each record.

        Parameters
        ----------
        records : pd.Series
            A DataFrame column containing records to extract information from.

        -----
        Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching in strings. In this method,
        we use a regex pattern to extract specific information enclosed within square brackets from each record.

        Here's a breakdown of the regex pattern:
        - `\\[` : Matches the opening square bracket character.
        - `(.*?)` : This is a capturing group that matches any characters (.*), but the ? makes it non-greedy
                   so that it captures the shortest sequence possible.
        - `\\]` : Matches the closing square bracket character.

        If the pattern is found in a record, the matched content is extracted and stored in the results.
        If the pattern is not found (or no matches are found), a default value of None is added to the results.

        Please note that the `str.extract()` method captures only the first occurrence of the pattern in each row.
        If there are multiple occurrences within a single record and you need to capture all of them, you might consider
        using other methods like `str.findall()`.

        For those new to regex, here's a simple explanation of how it works:
        - The opening \\[ matches the literal character "[".
        - (.*?) is a capturing group that captures any characters in a non-greedy manner.
        - The closing \\] matches the literal character "]".
