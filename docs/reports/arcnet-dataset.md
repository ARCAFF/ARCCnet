# Active Region Classification

## Introduction

Sunspot groups or {term}`ARs` classifications were some of the earliest properties used in forecast solar flares, and they are still in use today.
Initially {term}`ARs` were classified using the Zurich system {cite:p}`waldmeier1938`, after Hale's discovered of magnetic fields in sunspots this was followed by the addition of the Hale or Mt Wislon {cite:p}`hale1919,kunzel1965` classification and finally a modified version of Zurich scheme known as the McIntosh classification {cite:p}`mcintosh1990`.
Hale or Mt Wilson and McIntosh classification are still produced daily by space weather forecasting centers such as UKMet and SWPC.
Human operators use solar observations and guides to produce the classification and as such they are subject to variable biases and error.

The first task of {term}`ARCAFF` project is to train neural networks to classify {term}`ARs` in order to do this the first task of any machine learning task is the creation of the training and evaluation dataset in this case the "AR Localisation and Classification ML Datasets".
The task has been broken down into:

1. Active Region Cutout Classification -- given an {term}`AR` cutout produce classifications,
2. Active Region Detection -- given a full disk image produce a bounding boxes and classifications for each {term}`AR`.

To assemble these dataset data on {term}`AR` classification and detected bounding boxes mush be combined with magnetogram observations.

### Purpose and Scope of the deliverable

The purpose of this deliverable is to describe the input data and processes use to create the "AR Localisation and Classification ML Datasets" and also describe the datasets themselves.

## Source Data

### AR Classifications

The primary source of {term}`AR` classifications are {term}`NOAA`'s {term}`SWPC` {term}`SRS` reports which are jointly prepared by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce and {term}`NOAA`.
{numref}`code:srs-report` shows and example of an {term}`SRS` report the key information is contained in Section I and is:

* 'Nubr' - The NOAA number,
* 'Location' - Sunspot group location, in heliographic degrees latitude and degrees east or west from central meridian, rotated to 00:00 UTC,
* 'Z' - Modified Zurich classification of the group,
* 'Mag Type' - The Hale/Mt Wilson or Magnetic classification of the group.

{term}`SRS` data is queried, downloaded using Sunpy's unified search and retrieval tool `Fido` and is parsed using the `read_srs` method.
{numref}`fig:srs:coverage` shows the results of this processing in the form of a coverage plot of the {term}`SRS` data, of an expected {glue}`srs_expected_no` reports, {glue}`srs_missing_no` were missing,  {glue}`srs_error_no` could not be parsed, leaving {glue}`srs_good_no` reports for further processing.
Each {term}`SRS` report can contain many {term}`ARs` and an {term}`AR` may appear in many consecutive daily reports ( up ~13 days due to solar rotation).
The {glue}`srs_good_no` reports contain {glue}`srs_ars_tot_no` classifications across {glue}`srs_ars_tot_unique_no` unique active {term}`ARs`.
{numref}`fig:srs:map` is a heat map of all the individual {term}`ARs` locations, it demonstrates an interesting affect a lack of {term}`ARs` on the solar East limb (left of figure) compared to the West limb (right of figure) with some {term}`ARs` even appearing on the back side of the sun.
This is due to two factors 1) the difficulty in observing AR close to the limb and 2) the fact the AR locations are obtained at various times during the day and these location are subsequently differentially rotated to match the reporting time of 00:00 UT.
The daily {term}`SRS` reports can be combined to form a series for each {term}`AR` {numref}`fig:srs:trace` shows a number of such series and the path the {term}`ARs` trace across the disk, also revealing some issues.
Solar features such as {term}`ARs` should move across the disk at approximately the solar sidereal rotation rate of ~14 deg/day with respect to longitude with little variation in latitude ~ 0 deg/day.
The rate of change of longitude or latitude have been separately filtered to +- 7.5 deg/day of the expected rates resulting in {glue}`srs_ars_bad_no` bad positions across {glue}`srs_ars_bad_unique_no` {term}`ARs` to be filtered, leaving {glue}`srs_ars_good_no` classifications across {glue}`srs_ars_good_unique_no` {term}`ARs`.
